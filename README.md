# Introduction

This is an analysis of my sleep data. I did not use any app or gizmo (other than my)
laptop or phone to collect this data. I collected this data because I want to optimize my sleep so that I'm really active through out the day. This is just one among a myriad of experiments I'm running. 

So, here's the thing. This data was collected [by me] with the purpose of optimizing my sleep. I want to optimize my sleep so that I get the best out of each day. I want to know how much sleep I should get to make sure that my perception of the day is great (> 3). I'll be testing out 3 hypotheses in  this project. They are:
* Are sleep and perception of the day in general associated?
* Does getting more sleep improve the perception of my day?
* Does gettting less sleep improve the perception of my day?
* Does sleeping earlier improve the perception of my day?

To do this I'll need to first clean the data to make sure that the variables that I actually require are present in a proper and usable format.
Then I'll need to make sure that the data is adequate and run the required statistical tests and document the results. Those results are the ones I'll be using in my blog post.

# Code example

snake_case # to separate words in object names. 

library(lib_name) # to load the library

for() {}  # for-loops

Everything else is pretty normal

# The code
The names of the files disambiguate the order in which the files have to be run.
Just to avoid confusion, I'll mention the order once again. 
1. Run 01-data_cleaning.R
2. Run 02-analysis.R
3. Run 03-hypotheses.R
